In this case, it is a leaf node (i.e., it does not have any children nodes), so it does not ask any questions: you can simply look at the predicted class for that node and the Decision Tree predicts that your flower is an Iris-Setosa (class=setosa).\n",

A node’s value attribute tells you how many training instances of each class this node applies to: for example, the bottom-right node applies to 0 Iris-Setosa, 1 Iris- Versicolor, and 45 Iris-Virginica. Finally, a node’s gini attribute measures its impur‐ ity: a node is “pure” (gini=0) if all training instances it applies to belong to the same class.

The idea is really quite simple: the algo‐ rithm first splits the training set in two subsets using a single feature k and a thres‐ hold tk (e.g., “petal length ≤ 2.45 cm”). How does it choose k and tk? It searches for the pair (k, tk) that produces the purest subsets (weighted by their size).\n",

It does not check whether or not the split will lead to the lowest possible impurity several levels down. A greedy algorithm often produces a reasonably good solution, but it is not guaranteed to be the optimal solution."

So predictions are very fast, even when deal‐ ing with large training sets.\n",

For small training sets (less than a few thousand instances), Scikit-Learn can speed up training by presorting the data (set presort=True), but this slows down training con‐ siderably for larger training sets."

    "Decision Trees make very few assumptions about the training data (as opposed to lin‐ ear models, which obviously assume that the data is linear, for example). If left unconstrained, the tree structure will adapt itself to the training data, fitting it very closely, and most likely overfitting it. Such a model is often called a nonparametric model, not because it does not have any parameters (it often has a lot) but because the number of parameters is not determined prior to training, so the model structure is free to stick closely to the data. In contrast, a parametric model such as a linear model has a predetermined number of parameters, so its degree of freedom is limited, reducing the risk of overfitting (but increasing the risk of underfitting).\n",

    "To avoid overfitting the training data, you need to restrict the Decision Tree’s freedom during training. As you know by now, this is called regularization. The regularization hyperparameters depend on the algorithm used, but generally you can at least restrict the maximum depth of the Decision Tree. In Scikit-Learn, this is controlled by the max_depth hyperparameter (the default value is None, which means unlimited). Reducing max_depth will regularize the model and thus reduce the risk of overfitting.\n",

For example, if you just remove the widest Iris- Versicolor from the iris training set (the one with petals 4.8 cm long and 1.8 cm wide) and train a new Decision Tree, you may get the model represented in Figure 6-8. As you can see, it looks very different from the previous Decision Tree (Figure 6-2). Actually, since the training algorithm used by Scikit-Learn is stochastic6 you may get very different models even on the same training data (unless you set the random_state hyperparameter).\n",
